2. Paid for the book
3. Read this book

 Opting to read this book, trusting the author Chetan Bhagat was one of "My Mistakes in Life" !
I waited and waited, slept a number of times over the book, hoping that there will be a better turning around !!
Boring, Tiring... unable to express my disappointment !

 When i read other reviews about this book and also enquired with my friends, they were not very happy about this book but when i read this book i felt the same language which we are used to from Chtan's books, yes it is no where near to his works like "Five Point someone" or "2 States" but it isnt bad either, the way he gives background to each character and ties up all the loose ends together is what i like in this book as well, it also touches a few sensitive aspects of Gujrat but also explains how they impact business and people. 
On delivery front, i received the book in 3 days, which is pretty fast and the packing was good with no bent edges etc and the price is also good so a thumbs up for that

 I had really liked 5 point someone and Two states from Chetan Bhagat.. But this book is nothing close.. it even has a lot of grammar mistakes throughout..
The characters in the book are not people I would like to relate to either.. and random stuff keeps happening without much sense at times..
Just wanted to finish off this book quickly so that i could get on to the next one.. which i could, thanks to its small size..
I regret buying this one..

 this was the first book or more to say a novel I read in my life. you will be amazed to know i Completed it in 2 days. i could nt control my exitement of what will happen next after reading each chapter. Some good ppoints to understand especially Indian Politics and the most its dark side "politica of religion and caste". Well of all I like thios book and uhh... What can I say more. read it and have some time of exitement of what. surely not only sex. much about emotions. A good piece by Chetan Bhagat. well done..........

 Ok, So this is a story of three Gujarati guys and their experiences in their life, which is fairly told by Mr. Bhagat. BUt the Ending is Literally one of the worst ever makes me regret reading this book.. and there is nothing special in the story, save your time and read something more inspirational and motivational.

 only mistake of mine was to read it .i believe that chetan bhagat should stop writing n star doing some spritual work n put an effort to achieve purity of mind,because its better for a guy to buy alcohol than to buy his book.

 Even considering that Chetan Bhagat is not a great artistic writer, but is a author who appeases the masses, this book touches the lowest depths of literary mediocrity. The book starts promisingly but then veers towards the plot towards plain stupidity and at times makes B-grade bollywood movie plots look better!
This is certainly not what one would expect from the writer of a cult book like the 'Five Mistakes Of my Life'. This book was certainly a blunder in Bhagat's repertoire !

 Unfortunately and sadly, the FOURTH mistake of his life. 
A very very disappointing book.
Over hyped and overrated. 
Chetan Bhagat can do much much better than that. Too many expectations from him.

 I expected a lot from this one, but a sheer DISAPPOINTMENT is what I get in the end. I didn't expect this one to be more like a 'bollywood-masala' movie going on. Romance, Religious-riots, Cricket, Drama, it all seems like a boring crap going on.

 First book of [author:Chetan Bhagat|61124]'s which I felt boring... 
The prologue of the book was so interesting and I couldn't control from completing the book in 2 days (ya, it is a fast read for me).. But after reading this book, I felt the fourth mistake is me reading this book. It was so boring.  
But, the book was not so bad. The story had more twists then any B-grade Bollywood movie.. 
Not so up to Chetan's level (ya, he has some level in my view)...

 now what can i say about chetan who is world renowned for his novels but this one is worth to be in your collection....not as great as 2 states yet it had touch of everything in it.....it's not too interesting yet not so boring as well....

 It is much worse than his earlier two books. Five Point Someone was great, the Call Centre was OK with a stupid ending and this one is nothing more than the script for a C grade movie. It certainly does not deserve to be a best seller. 
5 stars,

 I don't know why I read it. The book sounds more like a bollywood movie. Twist and turns sounds very unrealistic. Climax was pure filmy. This was the last book of Chetan Bhagat I read. Will not dare again to do it, didnt enjoy a bit.

 AFTER FIVE POINT AND ONE NIGHT@ CALL CENTER CB PRODUCED THREE MISTAKES OF MY LIFE WHICH IS CB'S 1ST MISTAKE.I HOPE ITS CB'S LAST MISTAKE.BORING STORY WITH LACK OF BUSINESS POTENTIAL IN IT.VERY DISAPPOINTED AND HARDLY TO FIND INTEREST ON THIS BOOK 
3 stars,
 The weakest CB book so far. Too preachy for my liking. Still much better than CB clones that have flooded the market but then CB has to be judged by the standards he has set.
Good enough for a one time read.

 After "Five Point Someone" and "One Night @ Call Center" one expects the author to confidently emote a book which at least maintains the standard set by them. "3 Mistakes of My Life" is the biggest mistake of Chetan's Life! There's nothing in this book that actually works; the friendship feels like a hangover from earlier books, the love is boring (seriously "get me sand" that so Bollywoodish!) and there's no Chetan Bhagat comic timing (which is what connects him so close with non-reading type Indians)... If you have read all of Chetan's then read this just to know how badly he slipped before much better Revolution 2020!

 I think the movie 3 idiots has made chetan bhagat famous. I didnt like his literature. i read all his 5 books in a singlw week. my father had bought me his complete set and trust me, i didnt like anyone of it. altough revolution 2020 was comparably good. rest i hated, to be honest. I read novels from age of 13. maybe thats why I didnt like these books. I think his fame completely belongs to Amir Khan. No doubt..........

 chetan bhagat is an excellent writer, however this is not one of his best works. he has tried to put sex, drinks &amp; drama where none could exist. so my opinion it was some what forced rather than natural outcome of complicated life we lead. The story seems disoriented at various locations &amp; out of focus. 
i also found it a little biased against the UNCLE. he has put too much effort in portraying his evilness which seems very impractical &amp; at times forced. 
so my advice is skip this &amp; move on 2 states which is quite on the level of Chetan Bhagat but if you want a time pass novel &amp; don't need the Chetan Bhagat level, it is an okay book.

 This is like reading a hindi movie, with a few real scenarios merged in,
Chetan probably wanted to write another 3 idiots, to recreate a big box office hit
I don't enjoy hindi movies, but this was a page turner.

 this is a totally surprising book andone cannot figure it out what typeof book itis.you may have misconception that this book leads to some businesslegend story but it is noy then at some point of time you will think that it will be something elsebut it is nt .the end is not good i.e not intellectually written but any way worth reading for. at some point of time you will surely believe that itis some script of a bollywood movie and it is a superhit one . i finished the story in non stop 7and half hoursand i finally realisethat it was worth reading for.

 In lesser words, want ot mention its not like a book only and i felf like watching an indian movie, which has a good ending. Script was good and certain points like what one is waering, how one looked, create the point like its actually happening in front of my eyes and towards the end of last 40 pages just wanted to but could not stop reading...Its awesome and fantastically written book...and at this price if you are not buying it, It will be a big mistake

 I finished this book in a week. I started reading this book with slow pace. But as I finished reading up to 10 chapters I could not resist the temptation to finish. it It's a very good story about a person who wants to be successful in business and how his life takes unexpected turns...I particularly like the last 5 chapters which have many twists...Overall excellent read...

 I don't know how many trees were wasted for this shit, if you stop writing chetan it would really save us some trees and yeah why don't you just write for Bollywood, now that you write your every book assuming it would end up as a movie,FLIPKART there should be a option for rating some books like of C.B in negative 
P.S : Don't even think of buying this book
